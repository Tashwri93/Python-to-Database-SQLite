Please install the python dependencies to run the programs successfully:

-wget
-csv
-sqlite3

The three python files are as follow:

-downloadin_data.py is used to download the dataset from the website and to convert into a csv file.

-creating_database.py is used to connect to SQLite and create a database call 'Openflights' which will have
three tables created; Airports, Airlines and Routes.

-loading_database_to_sql.py is the csv files being loaded onto the SQLite database.

Below are some of the queries and solutions that I was able to complete. 

Query

Solution
SELECT Airlines.AirlineID, Airlines.name,  COUNT(*) FROM Airlines
Inner join Routes on Airlines.AirlineID = Routes.AirlineID
GROUP BY Routes.AirlineID  HAVING COUNT(*) > 100 ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC ;

Query
Which airline flies to the most countries?

Solution
SELECT Airlines.AirlineID, Airlines.name, COUNT(Country) FROM Airlines
Inner join Routes on Airlines.AirlineID = Routes.AirlineID
GROUP BY Routes.DestinationAirportID  HAVING COUNT(*) > 100 ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC ;

Query
Which airport serves the most destinations?

Solution
Select Airports.IATA, Count(SourceAirport) From Airports inner join Routes on Routes.SourceAirport
= Airports.IATA
Group by Routes.SourceAirport HAVING COUNT(*) ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC ;

Different Solution to same Query
Select Routes.SourceAirport, Count(*) from Routes
Group by Routes.SourceAirport HAVING COUNT(*) ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC ;
